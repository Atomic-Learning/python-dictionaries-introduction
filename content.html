<h2>Creating Dictionaries</h2>

<p>in Python, Dictionaries use curly braces <code>{}</code>. A key and its corresponding value are separated by a colon <code>:</code>, and key-value pairs are separated by commas <code>,</code>:</p>

<py-cell>atomic_numbers = {"H": 1, "He": 2, "Li": 3}
student_grades = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87, "Charlie": 92}
empty_dict = {}

print(atomic_numbers)
print(student_grades)
print(empty_dict)</py-cell>

<p>When defining a dictioanry with multiple key-value pairs, you can spread the pairs across multiple lines for readability. Indenting each pair is a common style convention (though not required by Python):</p>

<py-cell>person = { 
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York" 
} 

print(person)</py-cell>

<h2>Accessing Values by Key</h2>

<p>Use square brackets with the key to get the corresponding value:</p>

<py-cell>atomic_numbers = {"H": 1, "He": 2, "Li": 3}

print(atomic_numbers["H"])
print(atomic_numbers["Li"])

grades = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}
print(grades["Alice"])</py-cell>

<h2>Keys and Values Can Be Different Types</h2>

<p>Values can be any type. Keys are more restrictive in terms of what type can be used - strings and numeric values are most common (the technical requirement is that keys must be <strong>hashable</strong>). Within these constraints, a single dictionary can have a mixture of key and value types:</p>

<py-cell>mixed_dict = {
    10: 4.2,                 # integer key, float value
    "string key" : 8         # string key, integer value
}

print(mixed_dict[10])
print(mixed_dict["string key"])</py-cell>

<h2>Accessing Non-Existent Keys</h2>

<p>If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, Python raises a <code>KeyError</code>:</p>

<py-cell>grades = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}
print(grades["David"])</py-cell>
